1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
3. Finishing this assignment took me about 4.5 hours.

NOTE:

I'm not sure why this is happening, but I'll do my best to explain.

Entering the url "rodmagnum.github.io" takes you to my site. From there, all the links work. For whatever reason, however, the url's for the other sites are "https://rodmagnum.github.io/rodmagnum.github.io/index.html," instead of "https://rodmagnum.github.io/index.html."

Is this because of an error in how I set up my repo? For what it's worth, the links don't work when I try to open the index.html file locally unless I change the links' href attributes from "href="../file.html" to href="../rodmagnum.github.io/file.html."

I don't really get what's going on.
